## 📃 **About**

**Shiru** is a feature-rich anime library manager built around speed, control, and a seamless viewing experience, with full mobile support. Your files play directly for near-instant playback, giving you full native video performance with no transcoding and no compression.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This application **does not host, distribute, or provide media content**.
>
> Shiru is intended solely as a **personal media library manager** for organizing, tracking, and playing content that you **legally own**. Users are responsible for ensuring that all media content used with this application has been **legally** obtained and that its use complies with all applicable **copyright laws**.

## 💻 Supported Platforms
- 🪟 Windows
- 🐧 Linux
- 🍎 macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)
- 📱 Android 7.0+ (Nougat)
- 📺 Android TV 7.0+ *(remote navigation is a work in progress; mouse, keyboard, or touch recommended)*

## ✨ Key Features:
- 🪄 **AniList & MyAnimeList Integration** - manage your lists, auto-track progress, rate and score anime, and explore related series, all without leaving the app
- 🎤 **Dub-first support** - Shiru tracks both dub and sub release schedules independently, with a Prefer Dubs setting that hides series from continue watching until the next dubbed episode is available
- 🔔 **Real-time release notifications** - instant alerts for new sub, dub, and hentai episode releases, including delayed and batch announcements
- 💬 **Full subtitle support** - softcoded and external subtitles (VTT, SSA, ASS, SUB, TXT) with per-series subtitle memory, CJK glyph fallback, and in-player track cycling
- 🌐 **Extension support** - optionally bring your own content sources, such as a personal media server, directly into the app
- 📱 **Full mobile support** - a complete Android experience with landscape/portrait support, immersive full-screen, external player integration, and progress tracking
- 🎮 **Fully customizable keybindings** - drag-and-drop keybind editor with extensive default shortcuts for playback, subtitles, navigation, and more
- 📡 **Offline support** - your library, watch history, and previously loaded media are fully accessible offline, with local file playback and media resolving working entirely without an internet connection
- 🎭 **Multiple profiles** - separate libraries, settings, and watch lists per profile, with optional cross-profile sync as you watch
- 🖥️ **Discord Rich Presence** - shows what you're watching, your current progress, and paused/browsing states

## 🎥 Anime Features:

### 🪄 AniList & MyAnimeList Integration
- Filter by name, genres, tags, season, year, format, and status
- Manage your watching and planning lists with a built-in list editor
- Automatically mark episodes as completed after watching
- Watch trailers and previews directly in the app
- Rate, score, and explore related anime and recommendations
- Image search to find and identify anime by picture
- Fully customizable home page with user-built sections based on custom genres, tags, and search queries
- *Sequels You Missed* and *Stories You Missed* home sections to catch up on related entries

### 🎤 Dub & Sub Tracking
Shiru has one of the most thorough dub tracking systems available. Each series independently tracks its sub and dub release schedules, with per-episode audio labels showing exactly what is available and when.

- **Prefer Dubs** - a setting that hides series from continue watching if your progress matches the latest aired dub
- **Dubbed Audio filter** - filters the search page to only show dubbed series, and toggles the airing schedule to show dub air times instead of sub air times for currently airing dubbed series
- **Dub, Sub, and Hentai release feeds** - live feeds sorted by newest release so you never miss a drop
- **Dub and Sub notifications** - separate scheduling and tracking for both, including delayed, indefinitely delayed, and batch release announcements
- Audio labels on cards, episode lists, and the banner showing Dub, Sub, or Dual Audio status

### 🌐 Extension-Based Content Fetching *(Optional)*
Out of the box, Shiru plays files you already have locally. Extensions unlock additional content fetching for **legally owned** media, such as accessing your own personal media server remotely.

- Automatic series and episode detection from file names
- Support for custom RSS feeds and resolution preferences
- Adjustable network speeds
- Dynamic extension loading, with results appearing as each extension completes rather than waiting for all to finish
- Design and use custom [extensions](https://github.com/RockinChaos/Shiru/wiki/Extensions) to connect your own content sources

### 🔔 Notifications
- Real-time alerts for new sub, dub, and hentai episodes
- Delayed and indefinitely delayed episode notifications
- Series announcement notifications for upcoming anime
- In-app notification tray that tracks all alerts regardless of system notification settings
- Notifications are auto-marked as read when the relevant episode is watched
- Notification filtering by list status, so you only get alerted for what you care about
- Optional prefer dubs setting that ensures you are only notified when a dubbed episode is available, falling back to sub only if no dub exists for the series
